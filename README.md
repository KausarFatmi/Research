Abstract: 
This quantitative study investigates the impact of AI-based reading tools on reading performance among students with learning disabilities (LDs), while examining motivation and self-esteem as contributing psychological factors. Data collected via structured questionnaires from 270 students reveal a significant positive correlation between AI tool usage and reading achievement. Regression analysis further identifies both motivation and self-esteem as strong positive predictors of reading performance. ANOVA results also confirm that AI-based interventions significantly affect reading outcomes across participant groups. The study concludes that AI tools not only enhance reading but also foster engagement, confidence, and inclusive learning perspectives.

Objectives: 
To evaluate the relationship between AI-based reading interventions and reading performance in students with LDs.

To determine whether motivation and self-esteem significantly predict academic improvement when AI tools are utilized.

Methodology:
Design: Quantitative, utilizing structured questionnaires.

Sample: 270 students diagnosed with learning disabilities.

Analyses: Pearson correlation, multiple regression, and ANOVA to assess relationships and group differences in reading outcomes.

Key Findings:
A strong, positive correlation between AI intervention use and improved reading performance.

Motivation and self-esteem emerge as significant positive predictors of literary success.

Group differences confirmed via ANOVA indicate differential benefits among student subgroups.

Keywords:
AI-based interventions; reading performance; learning disabilities; motivation; self-esteem; inclusive education.
